## Document Status

The **file action bar** spec is now complete with:

✅ Requirements Document - Defines the feature with six main requirements 
covering action bar display, context-sensitive actions, file operations, 
permissions, user feedback, and long-running operations

✅ Design Document - Provides comprehensive architecture including component 
structure, navigation model changes, data models, error handling, and testing 
strategy

✅ Implementation Plan - Contains 12 detailed coding tasks that build 
incrementally from data models through to final testing and polish

## Summary
The spec transforms the current tree-based file navigation into a 
modern page-by-page directory browser with a dynamic action bar. 
Key features include:

- Context-sensitive action bar with buttons that enable/disable based on 
  selection
- Single-selection model for simplified user interaction
- Progress tracking for uploads/downloads with cancellation capability
- Permission-based access control for all operations
- Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

The implementation plan follows a logical progression:

- Foundation (data models, services)
- Navigation refactor (page-by-page browsing)
- Action bar (UI and logic)
- Quick operations (rename, move, delete, create)
- Long operations (upload/download with progress)
- Integration and testing
