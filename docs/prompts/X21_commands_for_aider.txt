/architect I have modified implemented and tested the authentication flow on server side. Now the client must be adapted.
Any not login-user should see the login page with login fields and button. The frontend cannot know who is regular user or admin.
The rules are defined on the server side. In detail: each admin must use 2FA with OTP and regular users have the option to use 2FA
with OTP. This option must be configurable on the server side. A regular user without OTP just enters his username and password
and press the login button. The server side checks if the user exists and if the password is correct. If the user exists and the 
password is correct the server sends a session token to the client. The client stores the session token in the local storage.
On the other hand are admins and users with OTP. The client sends the username and password to the server. The server checks if 
the user exists and if OTP is needed. In this case the server sends a 201 response and the client must show the OTP page.
The client must remember the username and password until successful login because username, password and OTP code must be send
together to /api/otp-login. Which files to you need to see or modify to implement the authentication flow?

/add docs/AdvancedFileServer_authentication.md
/add afs-app/... (some files)

The authentication is running now and manually tested. Update docs/AdvancedFileServer_authentication.md to be consistent with the code.

/add afs-app\src\main.ts

/architect Which files to you need to see or modify to implement for the following change?
The navigation bar should not be visible for not logged in users.

/ask You have a list of my source files. I seems to me that there are 2 navigation bars.
The first one is allways visible with "Dashboard" and "Files" as links. The second one is visible 
only for logged in users with "Files", "Shares" and "Groups" as links. Help me to find 
files which are responsible for the navigation bar. I wand to get rid of the first one.

/architect Which files to you need to see or modify to implement for the following change?
The login page and the opt page have no header and footer so far. I want to add them.

/architect The footer has a text "System Status: Online" on the left. This is not updated so far.
Can you add a service which updates the status every 5 seconds?

/add afs-app/src/index.html
/add afs-app/src/app/app.component.html

/architect The status check fails although the server is online with:
Server Error Code: 401 Message: Http failure response for http://localhost:8080/api/system/status: 401 OK
error = Object {timestamp: "2024-11-17T17:00:55.3867149", status: 401, error: "Unauthorized", message: "Invalid session: d9f4c694-c39c-4a0e-b182-5e34e6b2ded1", path: "N/A"}
Session IDs are blacklisted on logout or after some time of inactivity on the server.
1. The client should send a session ID for the status check.
2. The client should forget a session ID on logout and for fresh login.

claude.ai:
I have a an Angular application with following components or visible parts for logged-in users:
 1. A header bar with a logo and name of the application, a user icon, and a logout button.
 2. A navigation bar on the left with links to the main content of the application.
 3. The main content area with the main content of the application depending on the selected link in the navigation bar.
 4. A footer with a status info, a copyright notice and a link to the privacy policy.

 The main content shall be different for each link in the navigation bar. For the user it is a switch to a different view.
 I want you to explain how this can or should be implemented in Angular. Especially I want to know how to inline the
 exchangeable content of the main content area. The generated code I have already just opens a new page for each link 
 in the navigation bar.
