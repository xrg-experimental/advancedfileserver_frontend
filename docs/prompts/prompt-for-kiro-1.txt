# Requirements

I want to add an action bar on top of the `Files` page.
The connected server allows actions on files.
Depending on the selected file or directory, the action bar
should show different actions. Create a plan to implement this
step by step.

I want to simplify the interface and allow only one file or
directory to be selected at a time.

I don't want the action bar to change the place of buttons.
Therefore I prefere to disable non-relevant buttons instead of
hiding them.

No keyboard shortcuts.

The actual files view has a tree as structure. I think it's
best to change this to have a directory for which all entries
are visible and the user can go up or down in the hierarchy
page by page. Does this has an influence on thi requirements
document?

File upload and file download may take a long time depending
on the file size. Suggest some type of background process with
progress indicator and optional interrupt possibility. All
other actions shall work immediately.
