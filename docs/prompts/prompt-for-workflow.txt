I am evaluating Kiro from Amazon in the moment. The tool creates files for Requirements, 
Design and a Task list in `.kiro/specs/file-action-bar`. I asked an LLM:
"How can I create a workflow for Github with creating issues, PRs and reviews from these 
files?"

The answer was splitted in multiple files.
File docs/kiro-gitHub-integration.md has a description of the intended behavior.

I saved two files in .github/workflows for a GitHub workflow that converts these structured 
documents into GitHub issues, PRs, and reviews. The start script kiro-github-setup.sh shall
create the needed structure and other files that are used to support the Github workflow. Can
you help me to repair the script kiro-github-setup.sh because I get an error message:
./kiro-github-setup.sh: line 229: syntax error near unexpected token `)'

The following files should be created identical when using kiro-github-setup.sh:
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/kiro-task.md .github/pull_request_template.md KIRO_GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md
Update kiro-github-setup.py to recreate the same content.

In docs/kiro-gitHub-integration.md around lines 15 to 20, the Auto PR Creation
section lacks the exact branch-name pattern and detection logic; update the doc
to explicitly state the branch-name. Add 
"""
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/task-*'   # or 'feature/task-[0-9][0-9]'
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
"""

	modified:   .github/workflows/auto-pr-creation.yml
	modified:   .github/workflows/kiro-integration.yml
Update kiro-github-setup.py to create identical files .github/workflows/auto-pr-creation.yml and .github/workflows/kiro-integration.yml. 
These files needed to be changed to make GitHub workflow run.


The move command is not working as expected.
Assume we have a file example.txt in the directory /logs and we want to move it to /.
The API "/api/files/move" should be called with a MoveRequest containing the
variables "sourcePath" with the value "/logs/example.txt" and "targetPath" with the value "/example.txt".
Instead, I find "/logs/logs\example.txt" as sourcePath and "//example.txt" as targetPath.
