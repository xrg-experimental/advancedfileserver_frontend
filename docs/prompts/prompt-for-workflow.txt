I am evaluating Kiro from Amazon in the moment. The tool creates files for Requirements, 
Design and a Task list in `.kiro/specs/file-action-bar`. I asked an LLM:
"How can I create a workflow for Github with creating issues, PRs and reviews from these 
files?"

The answer was splitted in multiple files.
File docs/kiro-gitHub-integration.md has a description of the intended behavior.

I saved two files in .github/workflows for a GitHub workflow that converts these structured 
documents into GitHub issues, PRs, and reviews. The start script kiro-github-setup.sh shall
create the needed structure and other files that are used to support the Github workflow. Can
you help me to repair the script kiro-github-setup.sh because I get an error message:
./kiro-github-setup.sh: line 229: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
