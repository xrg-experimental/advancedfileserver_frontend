  - Integrate operations with FileOperationService
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Create progress tracking system for long operations
  - Create OperationProgress interface and tracking service
  - Implement progress dialog component with cancel capability
  - Add progress state management in FileOperationService
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 7. Implement file upload with progress tracking





  - Extend FileOperationService with upload method and progress tracking
  - Add file picker dialog integration
  - Implement upload progress monitoring and cancellation
  - Add multiple file upload support with individual progress tracking
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 8. Implement file download with progress tracking





  - Extend FileOperationService with download method and progress tracking
  - Add download progress monitoring and cancellation capability
  - Integrate with browser download functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Update FilesComponent template and integrate action bar
  - Modify files.component.html to use new page-by-page navigation layout
  - Integrate FileActionBarComponent into the template
  - Add breadcrumb navigation component
  - Update styling for new layout structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Implement error display system with snackbars and dialogs
  - Add success message notifications
  - Create error recovery mechanisms with retry options
  - Add loading states for all operations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 11. Create unit tests for all components and services
  - Write tests for FileActionBarComponent action logic
  - Write tests for FileOperationService API integration and error handling
  - Write tests for FilesComponent navigation and selection logic
  - Write tests for progress tracking and cancellation functionality
  - Add unit tests for UploadProgressDialogComponent:
    - Verify initial display and correct rendering of filename/size/state
    - Verify progress updates are reflected in the UI as OperationProgress changes
    - Verify Cancel button behavior: emits/calls cancel, disables appropriately during completion/error
  - Add unit tests for upload cancellation flow in FileOperationService:
    - Ensure cancellation triggers the cancellation subject, sets status to 'cancelled', and completes the progress stream
    - Ensure cleanup removes operation from operationsInProgress and operationCancellations maps
    - Ensure any subscribed UI observers receive the final cancelled state
  - Add unit tests for Dialog service methods related to progress/cancel dialogs:
    - Verify methods to open/close progress dialogs are called with expected params
    - Verify cancel hooks propagate to FileOperationService.cancelOperation and underlying subscriptions are torn down
  - _Requirements: All requirements coverage through testing_

- [ ] 12. Integration testing and final polish
  - Test complete user workflows end-to-end
  - Verify permission-based functionality works correctly
  - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - Optimize performance and add accessibility improvements
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
